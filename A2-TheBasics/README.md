Resources

A good resource for general HTML/CSS/Javascript is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). This contains all the references you need for front-end design.

A good resource for font would the the [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) project, with hundreds of different fonts to choose from so that you don't have to stick with Comic Sans. Or Impact.

If you want icons, look into [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

*Note that none of these are required for a good assignment, but it's generally a good idea to master a couple of frameworks if you are interested in developing web application in a real environment. As always, you should master the basics first before moving on to other parts*

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a popular front-end framework for building responsive web pages and in general makes your life easier. 

[UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) is another alternative to Bootstrap that you could look into. It is lighter than Bootstrap __and__ supports animation, if that's what you are into. 

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is an extension to CSS that makes maintaining/writing CSS easier and more fun. You basically write in Sass, and the complier will output a CSS file to use in production.

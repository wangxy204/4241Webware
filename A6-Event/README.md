there are 5 events

<p>T1: click the get time button to get current time, it contains hide element, innerHTML and eventhandler, addEventHandler()
<p>T2: oninput handler dynamic output the input characters, when you type any characters in the box it will trigger the 5th event.
<p>T3: click  to show hidden list 
<p>T4: when you use mouse scroll, you will see the number increasing, it counts the times of you scrolling the mouse
<p>T5:for innerTEXT, it's hard to think a way to show it. so I just make it change the font  when you press any key, becasue of the property of innerTEXT.
